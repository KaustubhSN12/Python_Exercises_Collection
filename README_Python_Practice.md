## 📌 Categories of Exercises

### 🔹 Basic Programs
1. Enter number from user and convert meter to centimeter.  
2. Write a program to calculate area of triangle.  
3. Write a program to enter a number from the user and check whether it is divisible by 7 or not.  
4. Write a program to enter nth number from the user and print sum of square of number using while loop.  
5. Print odd and even numbers series using loop (for/while loop).  
6. Accept number from user and check whether it is prime or not.

### 🔹 String Programs
1. Accept string from user and reverse the string.  
2. Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculates the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.  

   **Example Input:**  
   `Hello world!`  

   **Output:**  
   ```
   UPPER CASE 1
   LOWER CASE 9
   ```

### 🔹 List Programs
1. Write a program to accept n integer numbers in List, calculate and display the sum of elements from the list.  
2. Sort the elements from the list in ascending order.  
3. Accept n integer elements in list and display all elements from the list using while loop.

### 🔹 Function Programs
1. Write a program that calculates the squares of numbers ranging from one to 11 using a user-defined function.  
2. Write a program that can multiply all the numbers in a list using an inbuilt function (passing parameter to function).  
3. Create a function named `water_supply` that will calculate how many liters a given person would need to drink in their whole life.  
   - Takes two arguments: `age` (life expectancy) and `amount` (daily intake of water).  
   - Formula: `age * 365 * amount`  
   - Default values: `age=75`, `amount=2`.
